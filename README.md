# ESHack

A roguelike game writting in ES and Phaser 3


## Available Commands for building

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm install` | Install project dependencies |
| `npm start` | Build project and open web server running project |
| `npm run build` | Builds code bundle with production settings (minification, uglification, etc..) |

## Writing Code

After cloning the repo, run `npm install` from your project directory. Then, you can start the local development
server by running `npm start`.


After starting the development server with `npm start`, you can edit any files in the `src` folder
and webpack will automatically recompile and reload your server (available at `http://localhost:8080`
by default).



## Deploying Code
After you run the `npm run build` command, your code will be built into a single bundle located at 
`dist/bundle.min.js` along with any other assets you project depended. 

If you put the contents of the `dist` folder in a publicly-accessible location (say something like `http://mycoolserver.com`), 
you should be able to open `http://mycoolserver.com/index.html` and play your game.
